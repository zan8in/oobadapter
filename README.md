# oobadapter
OOBAdapter is a framework that consolidates diverse Out-of-Band (OOB) tools into a unified interface.

"Out of Band" (OOB) refers to a situation where information is transmitted outside the data channel. In the realm of security, OOB is typically used to describe a communication method employed by attackers to bypass defensive measures. OOB communication involves attackers transmitting information or executing operations through an indirect method, circumventing primary communication channels. This technique is often utilized to evade network security devices, firewalls, or other monitoring and blocking measures.
